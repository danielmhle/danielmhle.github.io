							<h1>Whitepaper: Cell-based Meat</h1>
                            <p><b><a href="">Link to full whitepaper.</a></b> Originally written in <b>Oxygen XML</b>, below is the part I wrote:</p>
                            <p>Cell-based meat, also known as cultivated or cultured meat, is produced by cultivating animal cells in a controlled environment. This process offers the potential to create meat products that closely resemble their traditionally-produced counterparts in terms of taste, texture, and nutritional values.[ChingEtAl2022] By replicating the structure and composition of animal muscle tissue, scientists are working to develop cell-based meat products that are indistinguishable from conventional meat. Due to the absence of blood, which provides nutrients and oxygen to the body, only a few cell layers can be produced using currently available technology.[FraeyeEtAl2020]</p>
                            <p>Beyond replicating the sensory experience, cell-based meat presents an opportunity to address some of the challenges associated with traditional meat production. For instance, by carefully controlling the growth conditions and nutrient composition, producers can potentially create meat products with enhanced nutritional profiles.BoguevaMcClements2013 This includes optimizing levels of essential nutrients like protein, iron, vitamins, and healthy fats like omega-3,[GFI] while reducing undesirable components such as saturated fat.[FraeyeEtAl2020]</p>
                            <p>A significant advantage of cell-based meat is its potential to mitigate the risk of zoonotic diseases – illnesses that spread between animals and humans. Traditional livestock farming practices can create conditions favorable to the emergence and spread of these diseases.[RubioXiangKaplan2020] Pathogenic microbes that spread through food consumption can have a range of effects, from diarrhoea to cancerous conditions, and eventually death.Giles2023 Animal agriculture sites like farms and meatpacking plants were hotspots for COVID-19 outbreaks.[RubioXiangKaplan2020] By eliminating the need for animal agriculture, cell-based meat production can help to reduce this risk, promoting public health and food safety.</p>
                            <p>Rigorous safety standards and regulations in production are essential to protecting public health. Cultivated meat production is subject to stringent protocols for cell sourcing, cultivation, and processing to prevent contamination. The production environment is controlled to eliminate the risk of harmful bacteria or viruses, like E. coli and Salmonella.[FoodSciBiotech2022APHIS] [E.coliCornellSalmonellosis] Additionally, extensive testing and quality control measures are implemented to verify the safety of the final product.</p>
                            <p>As a novel – new – food product, cell-based meat requires specific regulatory frameworks. Governments and regulatory bodies worldwide are actively developing guidelines to address the challenges in this emerging industry.[ChingEtAl2022] These regulations cover aspects such as labeling, traceability, and consumer information.[FoodSciBiotech2022] For example, with Singapore being at the leading research and development hub for novel food in Asia,[SFA2021] the Singapore Food Agency demands strict regulations for "alternative protein" products that do not have a history of being consumed. Companies are required to submit safety assessments to cover potential food safety risks, including toxicity, allergenic safety, production safety, and dietary exposure.[SFARegulations] Cultivated meat products sold in Singapore are required to label themselves with terms such as "mock," "cultured," or "plant-based" for consumers.[SFARegulationsChingEtAl2022] The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates the cell collection, storage, and cultivation processes of cultivated meat in the United States. Meanwhile, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) oversees the production and labeling of the final product.[USDA FDA]</p>
                            <p>Cell-based meat offers a potential solution to the environmental challenges posed by traditional livestock agriculture. Animal farming is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, water pollution, and land use. By reducing the reliance on livestock, cultivated meat can help mitigate these impacts.[FoodSciBiotech2022] Secondly, by eliminating the need for antibiotics and hormones commonly used in conventional livestock, it can reduce consumers' exposure to these substances.</p>
                            <p>However, like any new food product, cell-based meat calls for careful evaluation of potential health risks. While the growth media used in cell culture is carefully regulated, it is essential to monitor for any potential contaminants or allergens that could arise during the production process.[BoguevaMcClements2013] Additionally, the nutritional composition of cell-based meat needs to be closely monitored to ensure it avoids imbalances that could negatively impact human health.[RubioXiangKaplan2020]</p>
