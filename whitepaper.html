							<h1>Whitepaper: Cell-based Meat</h1>
                            <p><b><a href="">Link to full whitepaper.</a></b> Originally written in <b>Oxygen XML</b>.
							<br/>Part of the Professional Technical Writing program at the University of Washington program, PTW 330 course. Below is the part I wrote:</p>
                            <p>Cell-based meat, also known as cultivated or cultured meat, is produced by cultivating animal cells in a controlled environment. This process offers the potential to create meat products that closely resemble their traditionally-produced counterparts in terms of taste, texture, and nutritional values.[ChingEtAl2022] By replicating the structure and composition of animal muscle tissue, scientists are working to develop cell-based meat products that are indistinguishable from conventional meat. Due to the absence of blood, which provides nutrients and oxygen to the body, only a few cell layers can be produced using currently available technology.[FraeyeEtAl2020]</p>
							<p>Cell-based meat presents an opportunity to address some of the challenges associated with traditional meat production. For instance, producers can potentially create meat products with enhanced nutritional profiles by carefully controlling the growth conditions and nutrient composition of their product.BoguevaMcClements2013 This includes optimizing levels of essential nutrients like protein, iron, vitamins, and healthy fats like omega-3,[GFI] while reducing undesirable components such as saturated fat.[FraeyeEtAl2020]</p>
							<p>Another significant advantage of cell-based meat is its potential to mitigate the risk of zoonotic diseases. Zoonotic diseases are illnesses that spread between animals and humans. Traditional livestock farming practices can create conditions favorable to the emergence and spread of these diseases.[RubioXiangKaplan2020For example, animal agriculture sites like farms and meatpacking plants were hotspots for COVID-19 outbreaks.[RubioXiangKaplan2020 Cell-based meat production could help to reduce this risk by reducing societies' dependence on animal agriculture.</p>
							<p>Rigorous safety standards and production regulations are essential to protecting public health. Cell-based meat production is subject to stringent protocols for cell sourcing, cultivation, and processing to prevent contamination. The production environment must be carefully controlled to eliminate the risk of harmful bacteria or viruses, like e. coli and salmonella.[FoodSciBiotech2022APHIS] [E.coliCornellSalmonellosis] Additionally, extensive testing and quality control measures are implemented to verify the safety of the final product.</p>
							<p>As a novel food product, cell-based meat requires specific regulatory frameworks. Governments and regulatory bodies worldwide are actively developing regulations to cover aspects such as labeling, traceability, and consumer information.[FoodSciBiotech2022] For example, [SFA2021] the Singapore Food Agency demands strict regulations for "alternative protein" products that do not have a history of being consumed. Companies are required to submit safety assessments to cover potential food safety risks, including toxicity, allergenic safety, production safety, and dietary exposure.[SFARegulations] Dietary exposure assessments evaluate the dietary consumption of a specified population while examining the chemical residues that may affect that population.[BakerEtAl2001] Cell-based meat products sold in Singapore must be labeled as "mock," "cultured," or "plant-based" when being sold to consumers.[SFARegulations][ChingEtAl2022] In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates the cell collection, storage, and cultivation processes of cultivated meat, while the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) oversees the production and labeling of the final product.[USDA FDA]</p>
